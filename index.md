# Hi I am Titouan and this is a sum up of what I have done so far!

### Some little details about me :
I am a young 19 years old developer. I have been studying at Epitech for 2 years and it introduced me to the C and C++ language, but that was not enough for me.
As far as I can tell, I always wanted to be a game developer, and that's the reason why I really enjoyed working on graphcal projects such as a runner, an arcade machine or some personnal projects on Unity, I will explain that further.

### Summary :

First Year | Second Year

My_hunter | Arcade
My_runner | Ray-Cast Unity
My_rpg | Dodge-it

## Skills

Throughout my 2 years at Epitech, I had the chance to come across a lot of programming languages and different softwares.

Main skills | Good knowledge
------------ | -------------
C++ | Unity
C | JavaScript / Html / Css
Git | SFML

# Specification :

__C++__ : My favorite language so far. Easy to learn, it's a low level language which means that the developers have a lot of freedom to experiment and enjoy and it is used to develop games under Unreal Engine 4 so it's a big plus.

__Unreal Engine 4__ : The next software I will learn and use. I already used it a long time ago but I never took the time to really build a project on this software. It looks powerful, the last time i used it, it seemed user friendly to me and you can developp with C++ so a huge plus for this software.

__Blender / PhotoShop__ : Two softwares generally used by the graphic designers but I won't mind to have some knowledge on them since I am working on personal projects and plan to work on 3D games in the future. So two softwares that I will definitely learn.
