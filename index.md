# Hi I am Titouan and this is a sum up of what i've done so far!

### Some little details about me :
I am a young 19 years old developer. I have been studying at Epitech for 2 years and it introduced me to the C and C++ language, but that was not enough for me.
As far as I can tell, I always wanted to be a game developer, and that's the reason why I really enjoyed working on graphcal projects such as a runner, an arcade machine or some personnal projects on Unity, I will explain that further.
