### Hi i'am Titouan and this is a sum up of what i've done so far!

# Some little details about me :
I'am a young 19 years old developer, my first 2 years at Epitech introduced me to the C and C++ language but that was not enough for me.
As far as i can tell i always wanted to be a game developer, wich is why i took a lot of pleasure working on graphcal project such as a runner, an arcade machine or some personnal project on unity (more on that later).
