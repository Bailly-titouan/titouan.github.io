# Hi I am Titouan and this is a sum up of what I have done so far!

### Some little details about me :
I am a young 19 years old developer. I have been studying at Epitech for 2 years and it introduced me to the C and C++ language, but that was not enough for me.
As far as I can tell, I always wanted to be a game developer, and that's the reason why I really enjoyed working on graphcal projects such as a runner, an arcade machine or some personnal projects on Unity, I will explain that further.

# Summary :

First Year | Second Year
------------ | -------------
My_hunter | Arcade
My_runner | Ray-Cast Unity
My_rpg | Dodge-it

(All of my first project in C are not yet available on github since we were using blih at the time)
 
 
## First Epitech Year :

### My_hunter (Solo project | language : C)

Here is my first graphical project in C. A simple duck hunt with nothing really amazing in it, but it  is still my first project. I learned a lot about the CSFML library and the C language.

### My_runner (Solo project | language : C)

Here is my second graphical project in C. I had to develop a runner using parralax and a map on a txt file but I rapidly figured out that genereting the obstacles was way more powerful than using a map. I used to develop without taking the computer's performence into account, whitch means that with a better computer the player would run way faster than it should do.

### My_rpg (Group project | language : C)

One of my biggest project in C so far, but not my favorite. We were a group of 4 peoples which a lot of ambition, it leads to a lot of problem and a lot of feature either present or really bad. Even if this project is not my favorite it taught me a lot about working as a group. 

## Second Epitech Year :

### Arcade (Groupe project | language : C++)

<img src="https://bailly-titouan.github.io/titouan.github.io/Images/arcade_1.png" height="220"> | <img src="https://bailly-titouan.github.io/titouan.github.io/Images/arcade_2.png" height="220">

This project is the project where I really enjoyed spending time on. We had to developp an arcade machine using 3 different graphics libraries, let me explain. The real goal of this project was to teach us the effectiveness of the object-oriented programming. Using classes we managed to developp 2 games working on 3 different graphicals librairies which would have been impossible a year ago. I worked on implemanting the SDL library and the nibbler game.

### Ray-Cast Unity (Solo project | language : C# | Editor : Unity)

<img src="https://bailly-titouan.github.io/titouan.github.io/Images/my_runner_1.png" height="220"> | <img src="https://bailly-titouan.github.io/titouan.github.io/Images/my_runner_2.png" height="220">

This project was born during an experimental project. What is an experimental would you say, it is a week at Epitech used by student to developp a project using technologies we were not used to use at Epitech, this is why i decided to work on some 3D project in unity. Using Ray-cast i tried to reproduce the field of view of a person allowing the creation of really simple but very interesting, for me, stealth game.

### Dodge-it (Solo project | language : C | Editor : Unity)

<img src="https://bailly-titouan.github.io/titouan.github.io/Images/my_runner_1.png" height="220"> | <img src="https://bailly-titouan.github.io/titouan.github.io/Images/my_runner_2.png" height="220">

Allow me to introduce you to Dodge-it, a project born because I allways loved a game named "OSU!" and that i allways wanted to developp a real 2D game. I have a lot of hope in this project and lot of idea for it, as a fan of the rogue-like and rhythm games, i want to merge those two types of game into one to allow fast and enjoyable round on this game. A lot more is coming up for this game so feel free to contact me for more information or advice, I would love to hear them !

- [x] Base Gameplay
- [x] UI
- [x] Start menu / pause menu
- [ ] Fluidify gameplay
- [ ] Add rhytm into the game
- [ ] Add Upgrade and skill tree
- [ ] Upgrade the level design

# Skills

Throughout my 2 years at Epitech, I had the chance to come across a lot of programming languages and different softwares.

Main skills | Good knowledge
------------ | -------------
C++ | Unity
C | JavaScript / Html / Css
Git | SFML

## Specification :

__C++__ : My favorite language so far. Easy to learn, it's a low level language which means that the developers have a lot of freedom to experiment and enjoy and it is used to develop games under Unreal Engine 4 so it's a big plus.

__Unreal Engine 4__ : The next software I will learn and use. I already used it a long time ago but I never took the time to really build a project on this software. It looks powerful, the last time i used it, it seemed user friendly to me and you can developp with C++ so a huge plus for this software.

__Blender / PhotoShop__ : Two softwares generally used by the graphic designers but I won't mind to have some knowledge on them since I am working on personal projects and plan to work on 3D games in the future. So two softwares that I will definitely learn.
